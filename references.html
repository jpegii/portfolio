                    <p>"I worked with Julia during her time at School Outfitters, a company with multiple strategic business units, and I was immediately impressed by her ability to digest, collate, and align her actions with the business’ strategic plan. Within weeks she was running cross-team meetings between marketing and IT, and within months she was being recognized across the company for her leadership in shaping the organization’s HubSpot strategy. We attended agile Product Owner training together, and I witnessed her seamlessly integrate agile methodologies into her workflows such as sprint planning, sprint reviews and retrospectives. Julia is thorough, consistent, and deeply analytical and I’m confident she will excel in all of her future endeavors."</p>

Coming on board as Campaign Manager, Julia hit the ground running and immediately tackled projects large and small to start getting systems and processes updated and in place for continuous growth. She has identified new reporting and execution gaps in a short period of time and helped the subject matter experts around her identify and analyze their campaign performance. She is always eager to jump in and understand the requests and stakeholders of any project and dig in to learn anything she's unfamiliar with, and is great at keeping the key projects on tasks and herding all the cats. She's an absolute rockstar to work with and I can't wait to see what's coming!

She thought about how each touchpoint would affect others down the line and how they can all be connected for an effective message. When it came to the execution and communication of our strategy, Julia proved herself to be a capable leader. She always came to meetings prepared and ready to contribute with a can-do attitude.
